ðŸ‘‹ Hello guys. I am Binita Chand, a graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IOE, Pulchowk Campus. Iâ€™m particularly interested in 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. So, Iâ€™m currently learning about AI and ML by taking online courses from Coursera and reading AI books.
At the same time, I also wanted to do some projects on it and share with the learners of this field, that's the reason of creating this account. Hope my knowledge
and projects would help you alot.
